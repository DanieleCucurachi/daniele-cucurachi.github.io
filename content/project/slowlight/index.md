In the present work we aim to optimize the design of a coupled resonator waveguide QED (Quantum Electrodynamics) to obtain flat transmission on a defined frequency range through apodization. In order to reach apodization we slightly modify the physical parameters of the resonators at both ends of the waveguide device so that the reflections cancel out the Fabryâ€“Perot resonances at the resonant frequencies. This leads to a broadening of the characteristic peaks usually observed in transmission for coupled cavity arrays. Under optimal conditions we can exploit these broadenings to obtain flat transmission on a frequency band whose width depends on the number of resonators in the waveguide and on their coupling strength.
